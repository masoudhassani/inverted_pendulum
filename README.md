Votex Studio 2020a
numpy
matplotlib
Python 2 or 3

## How to
- Make sure that self.config_file in environment.py is pointing to the right place
- To train a model using vortex studio, run train.py in the vortex folder
- To playback a trained model, modify q_table_file in playback.py to point to the trained model in vortex/models folder
